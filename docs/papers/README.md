# Papers grounding the cost-review + routing hub

These papers ground the design of the LLM **cost review** ledger and the
**sync-vs-batch / upstream** routing added in `feat/cost-review-and-batch-routing`.
All three are arXiv preprints distributed under licenses that permit
redistribution; each is cited below with its arXiv identifier.

## Cost optimisation

- **FrugalGPT: How to Use Large Language Models While Reducing Cost and
  Improving Performance** — Lingjiao Chen, Matei Zaharia, James Zou. arXiv:2305.05176, 2023.
  `frugalgpt-cost-2305.05176.pdf`
  Motivates the **configurable price table + per-request cost accounting** and
  cost-optimising model selection: cost varies by orders of magnitude across
  providers/models, so a gateway should price each request and route to the
  cheapest capable upstream. Distributed under arXiv's non-exclusive license to
  distribute (arXiv perpetual, non-exclusive license 1.0).

## Query routing (which upstream / which tier)

- **RouteLLM: Learning to Route LLMs with Preference Data** — Isaac Ong, Amjad
  Almahairi, Vincent Wu, Wei-Lin Chiang, Tianhao Wu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, M.
  Waleed Kadous, Ion Stoica. arXiv:2406.18665, 2024.
  `routellm-routing-2406.18665.pdf`
  Grounds the **routing decision** layer (`RoutingPolicy` + cost-aware upstream
  selection): route strong/weak model choices to hit a cost/quality target.
  arXiv preprint; distributed under the arXiv non-exclusive distribution license.

- **Hybrid LLM: Cost-Efficient and Quality-Aware Query Routing** — Dujian Ding,
  Ankur Mallick, Chi Wang, Robert Sim, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Victor Rühle,
  Laks V. S. Lakshmanan, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah. arXiv:2404.14618 (ICLR 2024).
  `hybrid-llm-query-routing-2404.14618.pdf`
  Grounds **latency-tolerant vs interactive routing** and the sync/batch split:
  route easy/bulk queries to the cheaper path, keep hard/interactive queries on
  the responsive path. Distributed under the arXiv non-exclusive license /
  CC BY as marked on arXiv.

## Role reasoning-effort profiles

Issue #568 needs a provider-neutral `reasoning_effort_profile` so Fugu-style
route versus Fugu-Ultra conduct, TRINITY roles, and Conductor steps can share
one replayable compute snapshot. PDFs are cited rather than vendored when
redistribution is unclear.

- Sakana AI. (2026). *Sakana Fugu Technical Report*.
  https://github.com/SakanaAI/fugu/blob/main/Fugu_technical_report.pdf
  Grounds the latency-quality frontier: route is the low-compute path,
  conduct is the high-quality path. Do not proxy that split with temperature.
- Xu, J., Sun, Q., Schwendeman, P., Nielsen, S., Cetin, E., & Tang, Y. (2025).
  *Trinity: An evolved LLM coordinator* (arXiv:2512.04695).
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04695
  Grounds thinker / worker / verifier (plus synthesizer, planner, judge)
  role bindings on the catalog.
- Nielsen, S., Cetin, E., Schwendeman, P., Sun, Q., Xu, J., & Tang, Y. (2025).
  *Learning to orchestrate agents in natural language with the Conductor*
  (arXiv:2512.04388). https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04388
  Grounds workflow steps, recursion depth, decomposition, and access-list
  scope as first-class ablation factors.
- Baker, F. B. (2001). *The basics of item response theory* (2nd ed.).
  ERIC Clearinghouse on Assessment and Evaluation.
  https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED458219
  Grounds RMSE(θ̂, θ) as the accuracy metric. The ablation must emit θ̂
  and compare it to known true parameters; a rank constant is not an estimate.

Buyer next action: call `run_equal_budget_ablation` and read
`production_default_change_allowed` before changing live defaults.

## Evaluation methodology (NIM cost-quality benchmark)

- **Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM)** — Percy Liang, Rishi
  Bommasani, Tony Lee, et al. arXiv:2211.09110, 2022 (TMLR 2023).
  `helm-holistic-evaluation-2211.09110.pdf`
  Grounds the **NIM benchmark harness** (`docs/nim_benchmark.md`): evaluate a
  broad, explicitly enumerated model pool on multiple metrics at once (quality,
  latency, cost) instead of a single leaderboard number; report incompleteness
  honestly (skipped/unsupported/rate-limited cells stay machine-readable rather
  than silently dropped); and standardize conditions across compared systems
  (same tasks, scorers, caps, and budgets). Distributed under the arXiv
non-exclusive license / CC BY as marked on arXiv.

## Batch execution / load balancing

The external `pg-llm-batch` service carries its own grounding papers, including
PagedAttention / vLLM (2309.06180) and DeepSpeed-FastGen (2401.08671), which
motivate throughput-oriented **batched** inference and the load-balancing that
makes the latency-tolerant batch route economical. Those sources are referenced
but not vendored here so this repository remains one deployable control plane.
