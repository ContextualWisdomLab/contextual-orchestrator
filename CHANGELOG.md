# Changelog

All notable changes to `contextual-orchestrator` are documented here. The
project follows Semantic Versioning; a version is released only after the
protected `main` branch, required Checks, independent review, and release
artifacts are verified on the same commit.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Structured tool failure categories, stable fallback actions, and public
  adapter exceptions.
- Secret-free `tool_fallback_decision` audit events.
- Exact regression coverage for the Strix `Tool execute_command not found in agent strix` failure.
- Operator-managed model groups: `ModelAgent.group_name`, measured intra-group
  routing (Beta(1,1) posterior success probability over Jacobson-gain EWMA
  latency), group-alias model resolution, `/api/v1/model_groups` CRUD with
  normalized persistence, Admin editing, and routing-evidence display across
  text, image, video, speech, transcription, embeddings, rerank, and audio.
  (#834, ADR 0026)
- OpenCode Zen provider discovery plus explicit free-tier classification from
  reported zero prices or `-free`/`:free` id suffixes; `discover-models
  --free-only`. (#834)
- Versioned `reasoning_effort_profile` catalog (issue #568) with fail-closed
  parse, per-role bindings, replayable snapshot hash, and an equal-budget
  true-θ RMSE ablation that emits θ̂ and RMSE(θ̂, θ). Sampling temperature
  is not reasoning effort. Production route/conduct defaults stay locked
  until `production_default_change_allowed` is true.
  Next action: run `python -m pytest -q tests/test_reasoning_effort_profile.py` and keep
  live defaults unchanged while the gate is false. Pass
  `role_effort_catalog=default_role_effort_catalog()` to attach the same
  `reasoning_effort_snapshot` on `complete`, `run`, `stream_route`, and
  `batch_route`; omit it to keep today's payload.

### Fixed

- Reject missing profiles, blank `profile_version`, and fractional seeds.
  Snapshot hashing now fails closed on extra or missing roles. The
  production-default gate returns false on junk reports and on
  `measurement_status=estimated`. Access-list scope is a real ablation
  factor, not a duplicate label.

### Changed

- Agent invocation retries explicitly idempotent transient tool failures with
  bounded exponential backoff within a per-agent budget.
- A shared four-attempt ceiling bounds the configured same-agent retry budget.
- Fail-closed tool decisions have dedicated JSON and SSE error contracts and
  preserve the observed failure kind in secret-free audit evidence.
- Missing or unavailable tools move to the next eligible agent instead of
  terminating the workflow immediately.
- Strix B105 false positives eliminated at the source: KV credential-name
  constants renamed `*_CREDENTIAL_NAME`; readiness label keys renamed
  `readiness_ok/warning/failure`. (#833)

### Security

- Ambiguous non-idempotent outcomes, invalid arguments, permission denial, and policy denial fail closed.
- Fallback errors and audit events do not copy provider exception text, tool arguments, outputs, or credentials; fail-closed exceptions sever the original cause chain so later traceback logging cannot recover them.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

This is the current development baseline, not a published release. It
provides the OpenAI-compatible gateway, route/conduct orchestration, workflow
and access evidence, provider credential boundaries, cost and readiness
reporting, and security-focused contract tests.
